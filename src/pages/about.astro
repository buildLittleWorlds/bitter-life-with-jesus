  <h1>About This Blog</h1>
  <p>
    "My Bitter Life with Jesus" explores the intersection of two seemingly disparate domains:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Sutton's bitter lesson and implications of AI for contemporary life</strong> - examining how artificial intelligence is changing our world and what it means for our understanding of intelligence, creativity, and humanity.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Conservative Christian faith and devotional practice</strong> - affirming the Nicene Creed, the Apostle's Creed, the literal divinity of Christ, and the continued presence of God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit in contemporary life.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Through daily academic articles and creative non-fiction pieces, this blog attempts to wrestle with profound questions at the boundary of technology and theology.
  </p>
  <h2>Statement of Faith</h2>
  <p>
    I affirm the Nicene Creed, the Apostle's Creed, and believe in the Bible as the inspired Word of God. I believe in the literal divinity of Christ and the continued presence and work of the Holy Trinity in our lives today.
  </p>
  <h2>The Challenge</h2>
  <p>
    Each day, I will publish a new article or essay that engages with both AI's implications for our world and the enduring truths of the Christian faith. This blog is an experiment in finding meaning at the intersection of ancient wisdom and cutting-edge technology.
