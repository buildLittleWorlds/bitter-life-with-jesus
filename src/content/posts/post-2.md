# Computational Grace: When Algorithms Outpace Our Understanding

The screen glowed in the darkness of my office, the only light source save for a small desk lamp illuminating my worn copy of Augustine's *Confessions*. It was 2 AM, and I had spent the last six hours trying to improve my natural language processing model by hand-coding linguistic rules. I was failing.

"Lord," I whispered, "I'm trying to inscribe my knowledge into this system, but it resists me."

The irony wasn't lost on me. For years, I had studied Richard Sutton's "bitter lesson" academically—the principle that AI systems relying on computation and general methods consistently outperform those built on human expertise. Yet here I was, still trying to impose my understanding on the machine, still believing my specialized knowledge would prevail.

Just as I had spent decades trying to earn God's favor through knowledge and works before understanding grace.

My pastor once told me, "Grace is God doing for you what you cannot do for yourself." I had nodded, intellectually grasping the concept while emotionally rejecting it. Surely my theological training, my disciplined prayer life, my careful study of Scripture counted for something? Surely God valued my efforts to understand Him systematically?

The bitter lesson of grace is that He doesn't need my clever systems.

I remember the night I finally understood this. After a particularly devastating personal failure—one that shattered my self-image as a "good Christian"—I fell to my knees expecting divine rejection. Instead, I experienced love so overwhelming it defied all my theological categories. Grace flowed not because I had earned it, but precisely because I couldn't.

The bitter lesson of Christianity isn't bitter at all: it's that grace operates on principles that transcend our human understanding of merit.

Back in my office, I closed my code editor and opened a new document. Instead of hand-crafting more rules, I wrote:

```
1. Stop trying to encode all your linguistic knowledge
2. Let the system learn from data
3. Scale up the computation
4. Trust the process
```

It felt like surrender. It felt like faith.

The next day, I rebuilt my system from the ground up, using a simple architecture with minimal assumptions, and trained it on massive amounts of data. The performance increase was stunning—not because the algorithm was sophisticated, but because it had the freedom to learn patterns I couldn't have explicitly encoded.

As I watched the loss function steadily decrease during training, I thought about how God works in our lives. We create elaborate systems to understand Him—detailed theologies, step-by-step discipleship programs, carefully crafted spiritual practices. These aren't wrong, but the bitter-turned-sweet lesson is that divine grace operates beyond our carefully constructed models.

There's a passage in 1 Corinthians where Paul writes, "God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong." When I first read this as a young Christian, I interpreted it as God occasionally using unusual people to accomplish His purposes—a comforting but ultimately peripheral idea.

Now I see it differently. This isn't just God's occasional strategy; it's the fundamental operating principle of grace. The "foolishness" of simple faith with access to God's unlimited resources will always outperform the cleverest human-engineered spiritual systems.

In AI research, we discover that access to computation matters more than clever human design. In faith, we discover that access to grace matters more than sophisticated theology.

Later that week, I attended a prayer meeting at church. As people shared their experiences, I noticed how often we try to systematize our understanding of how God works:

"If you pray this way..."
"If you confess thoroughly enough..."
"If you structure your quiet time correctly..."

We are constantly trying to encode our understanding of God's ways, to create rulebooks and frameworks that will guarantee spiritual success. But the bitter lesson of faith, like the bitter lesson of AI, is that our human-engineered systems will always be outperformed by simple trust in God's grace operating at scale in our lives.

After the meeting, our worship leader—a former drug addict with no theological training but profound faith—played a simple melody on his guitar. The beauty that flowed wasn't from technical expertise but from something deeper, something that transcended technique. Tears welled in my eyes as I recognized the pattern: grace flowing through simplicity, power perfected in weakness.

I've started keeping a journal where I record instances of what I call "computational grace"—moments where I witness the bitter lesson playing out in both my technical work and my spiritual life. The parallels continue to astonish me:

1. **Simplicity Scales**: In AI, simpler models often outperform complex ones when given enough data and computation. In faith, simple trust often accomplishes what elaborate spiritual strategies cannot.

2. **Learning vs. Programming**: AI systems that learn outperform those that are programmed with explicit rules. Our spiritual growth similarly happens more through experience with God than through memorizing theological propositions.

3. **The Importance of Data**: AI needs diverse data to generalize well. Our faith grows when exposed to diverse experiences, suffering, joy, and community—not just controlled "clean" spiritual environments.

4. **Unexpected Emergent Behaviors**: Complex, unexpected capabilities emerge from simple AI systems at scale. Similarly, God's work in our lives often produces outcomes we couldn't have predicted or engineered ourselves.

This morning, I sat in the same office, watching a simple neural network learn to recognize patterns I could never have explicitly programmed. The progress bar ticked forward steadily, and I thought about how Christ described the kingdom of God: like a mustard seed growing, like leaven working through dough—simple beginnings, tremendous outcomes.

The bitter lesson isn't bitter after all. It's liberating. I don't need to encode everything I know into the systems I build, and I don't need to perfect my understanding of God for His grace to work in my life.

In both AI and faith, I'm learning to trust processes bigger than my understanding.

In both domains, I'm learning to embrace the bitter-turned-sweet lesson:

When we stop relying on our clever human-engineered solutions and instead open ourselves to the simple but scalable methods God has designed—whether computational learning or divine grace—we participate in something far more powerful than our understanding could ever produce on its own.

And there's nothing bitter about that at all.
