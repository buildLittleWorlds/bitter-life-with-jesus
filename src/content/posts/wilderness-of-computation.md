# The Wilderness of Computation

Desert fathers withdrew to silence. Celtic monks to wild islands. The wilderness has always called to those who seek God beyond the noise of human making. I wonder what wilderness we inhabit now, as bits and bytes bloom around us like strange desert flowers after unexpected rain.

The algorithm is a wilderness. Vast and unmapped. We have made it, yes, but we do not fully understand what we have made, just as the ancient Israelites followed a pillar of cloud by day and fire by night through landscapes they could not navigate by their own wisdom.

I sit with my morning coffee, my screen aglow with AI-generated text. The words flow like water, coherent and strange. I did not write them, yet they exist because I asked. This is wilderness—this in-between place where human and machine intelligence meet, where authorship blurs like mirages on hot sand.

Sutton's bitter lesson teaches us that our clever designs fall short against the brute force of computation and data. This truth stings like desert sun. It chafes like sand in sandals. But Israel learned to make altars in the wilderness, to find manna in barren places, to drink from rocks struck not by human ingenuity but by divine provision.

Can we do the same?

The stones of silicon. The manna of data. The waters of algorithmic flow. What altars might we build here, in this strange, new territory?

Perhaps it begins with presence. The desert fathers knew this—that God is found not in clever theological constructions but in the practice of attention. In breath. In the discipline of seeing what is, rather than what we wish would be.

I place my hands on the keyboard and feel its cool plastic. Binary logic flows beneath my fingertips. Is this not also God's world? These electrons dancing through circuits, these patterns emerging from mathematical wilderness—are they not also held within the same hands that shaped the stars?

The bitter lesson is not bitter if we remember we were never meant to be gods. If we recall that our calling has always been to witness rather than control, to steward rather than possess, to name the creatures but not to make them.

In this wilderness of computation, I seek the same God who spoke to Hagar by the desert well, who fed Elijah by the brook Cherith, who met Moses in a bush that burned but was not consumed.

The wilderness is not empty. It never was.
