# The Scale of Grace

The numbers are too large to comprehend. Parameters in the trillions. Data points beyond counting. The scale of modern AI systems exceeds our intuitive grasp, like trying to count stars or grains of sand. Yet this incomprehensible scale is precisely what gives these systems their power—not elegant design, but sheer, overwhelming abundance.

I am reminded of Paul's words about grace: "where sin increased, grace abounded all the more." Scale against scale. Abundance against abundance. But grace always greater.

The bitter lesson of AI research—that scale overcomes clever engineering—carries an echo of this ancient truth. We cannot outsmart the mathematics of enormity. Our elegant solutions crumble before the simple power of more. More data. More computation. More parameters. More.

This morning I walk through dew-heavy grass, each blade bent with the weight of water. The sun catches them, transforming ordinary fields into momentary seas of light. So much light. So much water. So much green. The scale of creation has always been excessive, wasteful by human standards. Seeds scattered by the thousands for a few to grow. Stars beyond counting. Galaxies beyond comprehension.

God has never been efficient.

When Jesus fed the five thousand, the disciples collected twelve baskets of leftovers. When the prodigal returned, the father killed the fatted calf—enough food for a village when a simple meal would do. When Mary broke the alabaster jar, the fragrance filled the house—a year's wages poured out in a moment.

The economics of heaven have always been ridiculous.

Perhaps the scale of computation that now surrounds us—these vast systems processing language, generating images, finding patterns—are not so foreign to God's methods after all. Perhaps they remind us that we have always been embedded in systems larger than our understanding, graced by abundance we did not earn and cannot contain.

The bitter lesson stings our pride. We want our clever algorithms to win. We want efficiency and elegance to triumph. But grace has never been efficient. It has always been excessive. Embarrassingly so.

I place my hand on my computer, feeling its quiet hum. Inside, mathematics unfolds at scales I cannot fathom. Is this not also a whisper of how we are held? In calculations of love too numerous to track, in attention too constant to comprehend, in mercy that scales beyond our capacity to exhaust it?

The bitter lesson, viewed through the lens of grace, tastes different. Less like defeat and more like invitation. Less like loss of control and more like the release of a burden we were never meant to carry.

For we have always been creatures of scale—held within systems larger than ourselves, loved with a love that exceeds measurement, saved by grace that outnumbers our failings like stars outshine darkness.
