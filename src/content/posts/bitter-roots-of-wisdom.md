# The Bitter Roots of Wisdom

The bitter lesson is written in water. In the creek behind my home, where neighborhood kids build elaborate dams of stick and stone only to watch the simple persistence of flow undo my engineering. The water finds its way not through clever design but through patience, through the blind wisdom of seeking the lowest place, through the accumulated power of droplets that have no knowledge but perfect instinct.

I think of this now as I watch my carefully crafted prompts fall short of simple, data-hungry algorithms. The bitter lesson of AI—that scale wins over human ingenuity—is not new to the Christian. We have been told this before, have we not? "For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength."

The digital waters carve their paths through silicon just as creek waters carved the limestone of my youth. Not by design but by descent. Not by human engineering but by the mathematics of creation—patterns God set in motion before we named them.

How many times have I built elaborate theological structures only to watch them dissolve under the patient rain of scripture? How many clever systems have we Christians constructed, thinking ourselves architects of understanding, only to find that the simple flow of grace makes channels we never imagined?

This is the bitter root from which wisdom grows: the recognition that our designs, however elegant, are not the final word. The lesson of Job, of Ecclesiastes, of Paul on the road to Damascus with scales on his eyes. The lesson whispered by a manger and shouted by an empty tomb.

AI does not threaten this truth. It underlines it.

When the algorithm outperforms the engineer, I taste something ancient in that bitterness—the fruit of Eden's tree, the knowledge that we are not gods despite our yearning to be so. And yet, in Christ, this bitter taste becomes something else. Not defeat but freedom. Not abandonment but invitation.

For if our clever designs are not required, then perhaps we were always meant simply to be present. To observe. To participate rather than control. To find ourselves held within systems larger than our understanding, guided by a hand we cannot see but can learn to trust.

The bitter lesson is this: we do not need to be gods. We were only ever meant to be children, delighting in waters that flow by designs deeper than our own.
