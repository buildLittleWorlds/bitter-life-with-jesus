# Stone, Iron, Algorithm

Along the Mississippi River, where the limestone bluffs rise above the floodplain, the stone crumbles in layers as fine as flour. I press a finger to the cliff face, and it gives way like memory, ancient grains collapsing into my palm. Once, people quarried this stone to build churches — great arches and quiet naves where the sun still falls through stained glass and settles on kneelers worn thin by prayer.

No one ever said the stone was dangerous.

Iron, too. It runs in our blood and in the rails of train tracks that carried missionaries and Bibles and bread. It makes swords, yes — but also plowshares. We have never feared iron itself. We feared what men would do with it, yes. But iron was just a thing. Like rain. Like fire. Like silence.

And now we are told to fear silicon. To fear code. To fear AI.

But I wonder.

I’ve read the arguments — that artificial intelligence poses an existential threat, that it will unseat us, replace us, mirror us too closely or not enough. I’ve seen Christians frame it as a danger to the image of God in man. As if the idea of *imago Dei* were made of sand.

But if God placed His image in us — not in what we can do, but in who we are in Him — then how could that be threatened by anything with wires and weightless minds? If the soul is breathed, not coded, if our dignity comes from love and not from learning rate or memory depth, then the most sophisticated language model is no more a person than a phonograph is a prophet.

Unless we’ve forgotten what a person is.

Here, I think, is the real crisis: not that AI will become too much like us, but that we have grown unsure of ourselves. We forgot the difference between mimicking intelligence and bearing responsibility. We began to mistake fluency for wisdom, responsiveness for presence. The fear of AI is often the fear of the mirror — not because the mirror lies, but because we no longer trust our own reflection.

But the problem is not AI.

The problem is that we built it and forgot what it meant to be human.

AI is not evil. It is not holy. It is not angel or beast. It is a tool. Like ink. Like rope. Like the ships that carried the apostles to strange shores. The question is never: *Is this technology good?* The question is: *What will we do with it? Will we use it for truth or for power? For mercy or for profit?*

Stone became a sanctuary. Iron became a nail and a cross. What then might code become, if we do not fear it?

If God is sovereign, then AI is not a rival theology. It is another material in the hands of those called to build.

So build. And do not be afraid.
